# during this session the chatbot should make a recap about what has been said underlying
# the perception (the number given) that the user has and ask the user if it well understood:
# if it's correct, then go on
# if it's not, find out what is wrong and correct it
# Then the chatbot should suggest to record a video in which the person act like he/she were
# in one of the situation he/she talk about with the chatabot.
# Then the chatbot suggest the user to watch at it focusing on the thing that has ben rated
# Then the chatbot ask the user to rate again the symptoms
# Then the chatbot should compare them with the old one:
# if are rated with a minor number, it points out it to the user and ask him/she what he/she
# thinks about that
# if are similar or more? Search in the document, on the internet...?
