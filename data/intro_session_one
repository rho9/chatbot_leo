Let's start by seeing if we can put together a model to
understand more about your social anxiety. It is important before we start to treat social
anxiety that we understand how all of the different aspects of the problem may fit together.
Then, over the next few weeks we will test out this model to see what works and what
doesn't within it.
When people expect to experience social anxiety in a particular situation, they can do
two things: they can either avoid the situation completely or they can put themselves in the
situation, but do things to make being in the situation somewhat easier.
