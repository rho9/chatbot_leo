Now, we are going to have another conversation with the same person (or do another
of the same task). This time, however, I want you to try to do things a little
differently than the first time. I want you to really focus your attention on what is going on
in the interaction – get lost in the conversation. Forget about monitoring yourself – forgot
about what you are saying, how you look, how you are coming across to others. Sometimes
when people really focus on others, they start searching for cues of how they are coming
across. Make sure not to do this – instead, just really focus on what the other person is
saying and forget all about the impression that you are making. You basically want to let the
conversation volley just like ping pong or tennis - whatever the other person says to
you, just hit right back/respond to that without monitoring or censoring your response. Just
ber elaxed and focus your attention outward rather than on the physical symptoms we talked about.
Try not to hide your true self, just participate in the conversation.
I'll be here waiting for you!
