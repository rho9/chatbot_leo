Now I have to ask you to play a simple role-plays. The idea is to record
you and another person (preferably unknown) who interpret yourself during yours
first meeting.
The goal is just to get to know each other, as you might if you were introduced to each other at a
party. When you are having the conversation, I want you to really pay attention to how you
are coming across, and to try to come across as well as possible. I want you to pay careful
attention to what you are saying and to how you look and to what the other person might be
thinking of you in order to make sure you are coming across well. I want you to also focus
on using safety behaviors, especially the one we just repeated.
There is no need for the meeting to last long... 5 minutes is more than enough!
Let me know when you're done =]
