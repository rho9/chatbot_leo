Now that you've seen both versions, what do you think?
You noticed how in the first video the attitudes that you usually take caused more anxiety
and less concentration?
Have you tried to compare yourself with your interlocutor? In the first video the physical
symptoms are really that pronounced compared to those of the other person?

I hope that this experiment helped you to understand that it is useless to adopt
such behaviors and that you are able to deal with a conversation better than you think.

My work here is done! I enjoyed interacting with you and I hope I've been helpful.
Remember that there is always someone who can help you .. I hope I have succeeded too
